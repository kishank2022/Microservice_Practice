Question - Where to place Jar & war Files in Tomcat Server?
Answer - 
	In Tomcat, the WAR file is placed in the webapps directory for deployment. Tomcat automatically extracts it and starts the application,
	when we start/restart the tomcat. Any JAR files required by that web application should be placed in the WEB-INF/lib folder 
	inside the deployed WAR directory. This makes them available on the classpath of the web application.
	
	Path = <TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps/myapp.war
	C:\apache-tomcat-9.0.73\webapps\myapp.war  ==== http://localhost:8080/myapp
	(Inside WEB-INF/lib/ folder of your WAR). A JAR (Java Archive) file is a library, not a full web application.
