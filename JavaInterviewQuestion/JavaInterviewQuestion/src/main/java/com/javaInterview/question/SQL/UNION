Union 
	UNION is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT queries.
	It removes duplicate rows by default. The number of columns and their datatypes must match in all SELECT statements.
	Slower in performance, it need to find and remove the duplicates.
	
	SELECT emp_id FROM employee_ids
	UNION
	SELECT emp_id FROM new_hires;
	
	
	
	
UNION ALL 
	Combine results, keep all rows (including duplicates).
	Faster in performance( because we don't need to find and remove duplicate)
	
	SELECT emp_id, emp_name
	FROM employees_2024
	UNION ALL
	SELECT emp_id, emp_name
	FROM employees_2025;
