	Intersection 
	
	INTERSECTION returns only the rows that are common to both SELECT queries.
	MySQL does not directly support INTERSECT â†’ you can simulate with INNER JOIN or IN clause.
	
	SELECT emp_id FROM employee_ids
	INTERSECT
	SELECT emp_id FROM new_hires;
	
	-- MySQL uses IN Clause, it does not support INTERSECT
	SELECT emp_id FROM employee_ids
	WHERE emp_id IN (SELECT emp_id FROM new_hires);
