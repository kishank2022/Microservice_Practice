	Abstraction - The process of hiding implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
	Focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.
	Supports loose coupling → promotes maintainable code.
	Hides implementation details → Users only see the method signature.
	
	Abstract classes can have constructor, static methods
	Interface cannot have constructor.
