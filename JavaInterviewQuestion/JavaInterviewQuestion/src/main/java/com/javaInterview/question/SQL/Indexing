Indexing in SQL - 

	An index in SQL is a special data structure (similar to a table of contents) that improves the speed of data retrieval 
	operations on a database table.
	Faster data retrieval for SELECT queries. Helps improve query performance for large tables.
	Takes additional storage space. Slows down INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (due to extra index updates).
	
	-- Basic Index
	CREATE INDEX empIdIndex ON Employee (emp_id);
	
	-- Unique Index
	CREATE UNIQUE INDEX empIdIndex ON Employee (emp_id);
	
	-- DROP Index
	DROP INDEX empIdIndex ON Employee;
	
	Important Points- 
	Use indexes on columns which are used frequently in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY.
	Donâ€™t index columns that are volatile (frequently updated)/ or the column values which are changing frequently.
