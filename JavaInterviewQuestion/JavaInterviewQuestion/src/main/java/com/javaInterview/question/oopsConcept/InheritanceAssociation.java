/*
 
 Inheritance in Java allows a class (child/subClass) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent/superClass) 
 using the extends keyword. It promotes code reusability and represents an IS-A relationship. 
 Java supports single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance, but not multiple inheritance with classes 
 (to avoid ambiguity), which is handled using interfaces.
 Private members are not inherited. Final classes cannot be inherited. 
 Static methods are inherited but canâ€™t be overridden (only hidden).
