/*
  Disadvantages of Spring Boot 
  1. Larger Deployment Size - Spring Boot packages applications as fat JARs (with all dependencies bundled inside).
  2. Slower Startup Time - Because it auto-configures a lot of components and loads many dependencies at startup.
  3. High Memory Consumption - Autoconfiguration often loads unnecessary beans and dependencies.
  4. Limited Control over Autoconfiguration - Auto-configuration is a great feature, but sometimes it hides complexity.
  5. Not Ideal for Monolithic Applications - Spring Boot is best for microservices and REST APIs.
  6. Version Compatibility Issues - Spring Boot internally manages versions of dependencies (Spring Data, Hibernate, etc.),
  7. Long Build Times - Because of many dependencies and plugins, Maven/Gradle builds can take longer compared to minimal frameworks.
